                        <p><strong>The five critical differences between SQL vs NoSQL are:</strong>
                            <br />
                            1. SQL databases are relational, NoSQL databases are non-relational. <br />
                            2. SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.
                            <br />
                            3. SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
                            <br />
                            4. SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.
                            <br />
                            5. SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.</p>

                        <p><strong>JWT:</strong>
                            <br />
                            JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued. <br />
                            <strong>JWT Works:</strong>
                            <br />
                            JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for, or what permissions the client has been granted. A JWT is a string made up of three parts, separated by dots (.), and serialized using base64. In the most common serialization format, compact serialization, the JWT looks something like this: xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz
